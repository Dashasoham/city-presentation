          One of the early mining settlements in the territory of Donetsk was
          Aleksandrovka. The existence of
          <strong>Aleksandrovskaya Cossack Sloboda</strong> in its place is
          attested by 1779., with the Aleksandrovsky coal mine eventually being
          opened there. The city of Donetsk was founded in 1869 by Welsh
          businessman <strong>John Hughes</strong>. The worker's settlement at
          the plant merged with Aleksandrovka and the place was named
          <strong>Yuzovo</strong>, later <strong>Yuzovka</strong>, after
          Hughes.In its early period, it received immigrants from Wales,
          especially from the town of Merthyr Tydfil.By the beginning of the
          20th century, Yuzovka had approximately 50,000 inhabitants,and
          attained the status of a city in 1917.The main district of Yuzovka is
          named English Colony, and the British origin of the city is reflected
          in its layout and architecture.

        <p class="second-paragraph">
          Under the Soviet Union, Yuzivka was renamed Stalino and, in 1961,
          Donetsk. Heavy destruction in World War II led to postwar
          modernization and an increase in industry, which resulted in
          substantial and sustained economic growth.
